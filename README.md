eyetracker
==========

Take images of an eye+reflections and find on-screen gaze points.

Requires OpenCV and Openframeworks. Developed with opencv-2.3.1-3 and of_preRelease_v007_osx.

This is similar to the eyewriter project, but with the goal of no user adjustments being necessary for operation.

Work in progress.
